# recipe-library-skill

here is a recipe libary skill for mycroft-   it reads locally stored recipes scrapped from allrecipes website .   to extract new recipes favourite  from  allrecipe web site
 simplly run ./recipe  with the url of the recipe on allrecipe.com
 example 
 ./recipe https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/230812/standing-roast-beef-brined/
 
 benifit of local stored recipes  is that you can modify download or add your own. to suit your pwn preference or correct any weird vocalization mycroft might have .  once a recipe has being downloaded it will not add another recipe of the same name to be installed
 
 it will automatically add it to the  mycroft  play list  and then is accessable  through the mycroft  voice interface
 
 list recipes   will  read out what recipes are in your libary
 
 find  recipe sourcough pancakes - will read out the recipe
 
 read me random recipe
