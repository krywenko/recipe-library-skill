standing roast beef brined

 Ingredients
  8 cups warm water
  8 cups brewed French-roast coffee
  1 cup kosher salt
  1 1 ounce package dry French onion soup mix
  1 onion, diced
  1/4 cup minced garlic
  2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
  1 6 pound standing beef rib roast
  2 teaspoons garlic powder, or to taste
  2 teaspoons onion powder, or more to taste
  ground black pepper to taste
Directions
    Stir warm water, coffee, kosher salt, onion soup mix, onion, garlic, and Worcestershire sauce in a 16-quart stock pot until salt and onion soup mix has dissolved. Lay roast in the brine and cover pot; refrigerate at least 8 hours. Turn roast over at least twice during brining
Preheat oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit  190 degrees Celsius 
Remove roast from brine and pat dry with paper towels. Place roast on a rack in a roasting pan with the fat side down; sprinkle with garlic powder, onion powder, and black pepper. Flip roast and season other side the same way. Let roast stand until it reaches room temperature, about 1 hour
Place roast into preheated oven and bake for 1 hour
Turn off heat and leave meat in the hot oven, without opening oven door, for 3 hours. Turn oven back on and set heat for 375 degrees Fahrenheit  190 degrees Celsius . Let roast reheat until an instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the center of the roast reads 130 degrees Fahrenheit  54 degrees Celsius  for medium-rare, 30 to 40 minutes.
